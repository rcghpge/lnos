## Overview
> **NOTE:** This is a sandbox build of upstream LN OS. It is highly experimental and not recommended to try on your dedicated machine yet since it hasn't been thoughrougly tested.
> For mainline Arch Linux, we recommend a stable installation and following the official [Arch Linux installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) for the most accurate and up-to-date instructions.
> Please see mainline LN OS dev at source tree for the most up to date build: [LN OS](https://github.com/uta-lug-nuts/LnOS.git)

The LN Project is a custom Linux distribution based on Arch Linux, originally designed for University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) students. It aims to provide a lightweight, flexible, and powerful environment tailored to the needs of engineering students. The distro supports both x86_64 and ARM architectures (e.g., Raspberry Pi), ensuring compatibility with a wide range of student hardware.

* First focused discipline is Computer Science (CS). 

## Goals 

* Lightweight and minimal base, built from Arch Linux.
* Pre-configured tools for CS students, with plans to expand to other engineering disciplines (e.g., EE).
* Easy installation process for students new to Linux.
* Rolling updates to keep software current. (tool to update easily TUI)
* Easy to read Documentation source not only for LnOS but for any configurable tool thats on Arch Linux

## Features

* **Target Architectures:** x86_64 and (aarch64 / aarch32) 
  * Arm we're still researching (v7 or v8)
* **Base System:** Minimal Arch Linux with a rolling release model.
* **Major Themed presets:** Engineers will have preset options to choose  
* **Desktop Environment:** [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/)(similar to macos) [KDE](https://kde.org/)(similar to windows) and Tiling Window Managers like [Hyprland](https://hypr.land/), and [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/).

## Installation Instructions

### Custom ISO Installation

Pre-built LnOS ISOs are available with the installer included.

#### Option 1: Download Pre-built ISO
1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/uta-lug-nuts/LnOS/releases)
   - `lnos-x86_64-*.iso` for Intel/AMD 64-bit systems
   - `lnos-aarch64-*.iso` for ARM 64-bit systems (Raspberry Pi 4+)

2. Create bootable USB:
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   sudo dd if=lnos-x86_64-*.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
   
   # Windows: Use Rufus or Balena Etcher
   ```

3. Boot and install:
   - Boot from USB (automatic login as root)
   - Run the installer: `cd /root/LnOS/scripts && ./LnOS-installer.sh --target=x86_64`
   - Follow the interactive prompts to select packages and desktop environment

#### Option 2: Build Custom ISO

##### Using VS Code Dev Container
1. Install VS Code with "Dev Containers" extension
2. Clone and open: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rcghpge/lnos.git
   cd LnOS
   code .
   ```
3. Open in container: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
4. Build ISO: 
   ```bash
   ./build-iso.sh x86_64     # Build x86_64 ISO
   ./build-iso.sh aarch64    # Build ARM64 ISO
   ```

##### Using Local Arch Linux
```bash
# Install archiso
sudo pacman -S archiso

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/rcghpge/lnos.git
cd LnOS
./build-iso.sh x86_64
```

##### Using Docker
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rcghpge/lnos.git
cd LnOS

# Build in Arch container
docker run --rm --privileged \
  -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  -w /workspace \
  archlinux:latest \
  bash -c "
    pacman -Syu --noconfirm
    pacman -S --noconfirm archiso
    ./build-iso.sh x86_64
  "
```

### Development Environment

To contribute to LnOS, use the VS Code dev container:

1. Install VS Code with "Dev Containers" extension
2. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/uta-lug-nuts/LnOS.git`
3. Open in VS Code: `code LnOS`
4. Reopen in container: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

The dev container includes:
- Arch Linux environment
- Pre-installed archiso and build tools
- Build aliases: `build-x86`, `build-arm`, `clean-build`
- Shell script linting and formatting
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Manual Installation

1. Download Arch Linux ISO from [archlinux.org/download](https://archlinux.org/download/)

2. Create bootable media using [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) or [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher)

3. Boot and install:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uta-lug-nuts/LnOS.git
   ./LnOS/scripts/LnOS-installer.sh --target=x86_64
   ```
