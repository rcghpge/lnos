LnOS for Windows Dev

# LnOS at command line (Arch Linux):
- sudo requires workarounds example: echo "nameserver 1.1.1.1" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf > /dev/null
- no default text editor set in place for base system configs

# Launching LnOS from PowerShell Windows 10 QEMU VM:
- missing alot of firmware and firmware modules consolefont, ast, etc
- `archiso/airootfs/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` needs refactoring/patching for this for Windows 10/11


# Internet/WiFi Networking After Install:
- has issues install pacman packages. detects pacman packages, but cannot resolve host [error]
- missing `/etc/resolv.conf`
- no `dhcpcd` for network configs
- checks needed: `systemd-networkd`, `dhclient`
